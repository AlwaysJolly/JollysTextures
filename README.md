# JollysTextures


-- Almost all the data listed here is outdated. 

-- There is no complete list of every item name.

-- The Latest Update (v1.7.1) was built for Minecraft Version 1.21.

-- CIT RESEWN (https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) is required for the pack to function.

-- Not all models were made by me, credits to Crafty73 for the Roxanne Wolf Plush totem.

-- Written Books (that are name based) no longer function AT ALL.

-- If you would like the download for the Showcase World that has all custom items, DM me on Discord (@JollySpider) otherwise just search through the pack files.


The Notables community resource pack,

OptiFine is required for the pack to function, when installing make sure that the file inside of your resource packs folder contains the pack.png file, and not a second Jolly's Textures file, if inside is a second Jolly's Textures file, move that one to the Resource Pack folder and delete the first one. The Resource Pack was built for 1.19.2,
other versions have not been tested, if textures do not work then either manually fix them yourself or downgrade / upgrade to 1.19.2 so that it works.
